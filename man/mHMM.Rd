\arguments{
\item{s_data}{A matrix containing the observations to be modeled, where the
rows represent the observations over time. In \code{s_data}, the first
column indicates subject id number. Hence, the id number is repeated over
rows equal to the number of observations for that subject. The subsequent
columns contain the dependent variable(s). Note that the dependent
variables have to be numeric, i.e., they cannot be a (set of) factor
variable(s). The total number of rows are equal to the sum over the number
of observations of each subject, and the number of columns are equal to the
number of dependent variables (\code{n_dep}) + 1. The number of
observations can vary over subjects.}

\item{gen}{List containing the following elements denoting the general model
properties:
\itemize{\item{\code{m}: numeric vector with length 1 denoting the number
of hidden states}
\item{\code{n_dep}: numeric vector with length 1 denoting the
number of dependent variables}
\item{\code{q_emiss}: numeric vector with length \code{n_dep} denoting the
number of observed categories for the categorical emission distribution
for each of the dependent variables.}}}

\item{xx}{An optional list of (level 2) covariates to predict the transition
  matrix and/or the emission probabilities. Level 2 covariate(s) means that
  there is one observation per subject of each covariate. The first element
  in the list \code{xx} is used to predict the transition matrix. Subsequent
  elements in the list are used to predict the emission distribution of (each
  of) the dependent variable(s). Each element in the list is a matrix, with
  the number of rows equal to the number of subjects. The first column of
  each matrix represents the intercept, that is, a column only consisting of
  ones. Subsequent columns correspond to covariates used to predict the
  transition matrix / emission distribution. See \emph{Details} for more
  information on the use of covariates.

  If \code{xx} is omitted completely, \code{xx} defaults to \code{NULL},
  resembling no covariates. Specific elements in the list can also be left
  empty (i.e., set to \code{NULL}) to signify that either the transition
  probability matrix or a specific emission distribution is not predicted by
  covariates.}

\item{start_val}{List containing the start values for the transition
probability matrix gamma and the emission distribution(s). The first
element of the list contains a \code{m} by \code{m} matrix with the start
values for gamma. The subsequent elements contain \code{m} by
\code{q_emiss[k]} matrices for the start values for each of the \code{k} in
\code{n_dep} emission distribution(s). Note that \code{start_val} should not contain
nested lists (i.e., lists within lists).}

\item{mcmc}{List of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) arguments, containing the
following elements:
\itemize{\item{\code{J}: numeric vector with length 1 denoting the number
of iterations of the MCMC algorithm}
\item{\code{burn_in}: numeric vector with length 1 denoting the
burn-in period for the MCMC algorithm.}}}

\item{return_path}{A logical scalar. Should the sampled state sequence
obtained at each iteration and for each subject be returned by the function
(\code{sample_path = TRUE}) or not (\code{sample_path = FALSE}). Note that
the sampled state sequence is quite a large object, hence the default
setting is \code{sample_path = FALSE}. Can be used for local decoding
purposes.}

\item{print_iter}{The argument print_iter is deprecated; please use
\code{show_progress} instead to show the progress of the algorithm.}

\item{show_progress}{A logical scaler. Should the function show a text
progress bar in the \code{R} console to represent the progress of the
algorithm (\code{show_progress = TRUE}) or not (\code{show_progress =
FALSE}). Defaults to \code{show_progress = TRUE}.}

\item{gamma_hyp_prior}{An optional object of class \code{mHMM_prior_gamma}
containing user specified parameter values for the hyper-prior distribution
on the transition probability matrix gamma, generated by the function
\code{\link{prior_gamma}}.}

\item{emiss_hyp_prior}{An optional object of the class
\code{mHMM_prior_emiss} containing user specified parameter values for the
hyper-prior distribution on categorical the emission distribution,
generated by the function \code{\link{prior_emiss_cat}}.}

\item{gamma_sampler}{An optional object of the class \code{mHMM_pdRW_gamma}
containing user specified settings for the proposal distribution of the
random walk (RW) Metropolis sampler on the subject level transition
probability matrix parameters, generated by the function
\code{\link{pd_RW_gamma}}.}

\item{emiss_sampler}{An optional object of the class \code{mHMM_pdRW_emiss}
containing user specified settings for the proposal distribution of the
random walk (RW) Metropolis sampler on the subject level emission
distribution(s) parameters, generated by the function
\code{\link{pd_RW_emiss_cat}}.}

\description{
\code{mHMM} fits a multilevel (also known as mixed or random effects) hidden
Markov model (HMM) to intense longitudinal data with categorical observations
of multiple subjects using Bayesian estimation, and creates an object of
class mHMM. By using a multilevel framework, we allow for heterogeneity in
the model parameters between subjects, while estimating one overall HMM. The
function includes the possibility to add covariates at level 2 (i.e., at the
subject level) and have varying observation lengths over subjects. For a
short description of the package see \link{mHMMbayes}. See
\code{vignette("tutorial-mhmm")} for an introduction to multilevel hidden
Markov models and the package, and see \code{vignette("estimation-mhmm")} for
an overview of the used estimation algorithms.
}
\details{
Covariates specified in \code{xx} can either be dichotomous or continuous
variables. Dichotomous variables have to be coded as 0/1 variables.
Categorical or factor variables can as yet not be used as predictor
covariates. The user can however break up the categorical variable in
multiple dummy variables (i.e., dichotomous variables), which can be used
simultaneously in the analysis. Continuous predictors are automatically
centered. That is, the mean value of the covariate is subtracted from all
values of the covariate such that the new mean equals zero. This is done such
that the presented probabilities in the output (i.e., for the population
transition probability matrix and population emission probabilities)
correspond to the predicted probabilities at the average value of the
covariate(s).
