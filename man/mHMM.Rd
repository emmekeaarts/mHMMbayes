\arguments{
\item{s_data}{A matrix containing the observations to be modelled, where the
rows represent the observations over time. In \code{s_data}, the first
column indicates subject id number. Hence, the id number is repeated over
rows equal to the number of observations for that subject. The subsequent
columns contain the dependent variable(s). Note that the dependent
variables have to be numeric, i.e., they cannot be a (set of) factor
variable(s). The total number of rows are equal to the sum over the number
of observations of each subject, and the number of columns are equal to the
number of dependent variables (\code{n_dep}) + 1. The number of
observations can vary over subjects.}

\item{gen}{List containing the following elements denoting the general model
properties:
\itemize{\item{\code{m}: numeric vector with length 1 denoting the number
of hidden states}
\item{\code{n_dep}: numeric vector with length 1 denoting the
number of dependent variables}
\item{\code{q_emiss}: numeric vector with length \code{n_dep} denoting the
number of observed categories for the categorical emission distribution
for each of the dependent variables.}}}

\item{xx}{An optional list of (level 2) covariates to predict the transition
  matrix and/or the emission probabilities. Level 2 covariate(s) means that
  there is one observation per subject of each covariate. The first element
  in the list \code{xx} is used to predict the transition matrix. Subsequent
  elements in the list are used to predict the emission distribution of (each
  of) the dependent variable(s). Each element in the list is a matrix, with
  the number of rows equal to the number of subjects. The first column of
  each matrix represents the intercept, that is, a column only consisting of
  ones. Subsequent columns correspond to covariates used to predict the
  transition matrix / emission distribution. See \emph{Details} for more
  information on the use of covariates.

  If \code{xx} is omitted completely, \code{xx} defaults to \code{NULL},
  resembling no covariates. Specific elements in the list can also be left
  empty (i.e., set to \code{NULL}) to signify that either the transition
  probability matrix or a specific emission distribution is not predicted by
  covariates.}

\item{start_val}{List containing the start values for the transition
probability matrix gamma and the emission distribution(s). The first
element of the list contains a \code{m} by \code{m} matrix with the start
values for gamma. The subsequent elements contain \code{m} by
\code{q_emiss[k]} matrices for the start values for each of the \code{k} in
\code{n_dep} emission distribution(s). Note that \code{start_val} should not contain
nested lists (i.e., lists within lists).}

\item{mcmc}{List of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) arguments, containing the
following elements:
\itemize{\item{\code{J}: numeric vector with length 1 denoting the number
of iterations of the MCMC algorithm}
\item{\code{burn_in}: numeric vector with length 1 denoting the
burn-in period for the MCMC algorithm.}}}

\item{return_path}{A logical scalar. Should the sampled state sequence
obtained at each iteration and for each subject be returned by the function
(\code{sample_path = TRUE}) or not (\code{sample_path = FALSE}). Note that
the sampled state sequence is quite a large object, hence the default
setting is \code{sample_path = FALSE}. Can be used for local decoding
purposes.}

\item{print_iter}{The argument print_iter is depricated; please use
show_progress instead to show the progress of the algorithm.}

\item{show_progress}{A logical scaler. Should the function show a text
progress bar in the \code{R} console to represent the progress of the
algorithm (\code{show_progress = TRUE}) or not (\code{show_progress =
FALSE}). Defaults to \code{show_progress = TRUE}.}

\item{gamma_hyp_prior}{An optional list containing user specified parameters
 of the hyper-prior distribution on the multivariate normal distribution
 of the intercepts (and regression coefficients given that covariates are
 used) of the multinomial regression model of the transition probability
 matrix gamma. The hyper-prior of the mean intercepts is a multivariate
 Normal distribution, the hyper-prior of the covariance matrix between the
 set of (state specific) intercepts is an Inverse Wishart distribution.

 Hence, the list \code{gamma_hyp_prior} contains the following elements:
 \itemize{\item{\code{gamma_mu0}: a list containing m matrices; one matrix
 for each row of the transition probability matrix gamma. Each matrix
 contains the hypothesized mean values of the intercepts. Hence, each matrix
 consists of one row (when not including covariates in the model) and
 \code{m} - 1 columns}
 \item{\code{gamma_K0}: numeric vector with length 1 denoting the number of
 hypothetical prior subjects on which the vector of means \code{gamma_mu0} is
 based}
 \item{\code{gamma_nu}: numeric vector with length 1 denoting the degrees of
 freedom of the Inverse Wishart distribution}
 \item{\code{gamma_V}: matrix of \code{m} - 1 by \code{m} - 1 containing the
 hypothesized variance-covariance matrix between the set of intercepts.}}
 Note that \code{gamma_K0}, \code{gamma_nu} and \code{gamma_V} are assumed
 equal over the states. The mean values of the intercepts (and regression
 coefficients of the covariates) denoted by \code{gamma_mu0} are allowed to
 vary over the states.

 The default values for the hyper-prior on gamma are: all elements of the
 matrices contained in \code{gamma_mu0} set to 0, \code{gamma_K0} set to 1,
 \code{gamma_nu} set to 3 + m - 1, and the diagonal of \code{gamma_V} (i.e.,
 the variance) set to 3 + m - 1 and the off-diagonal elements (i.e., the
 covariance) set to 0.

 See \emph{Details} below if covariates are used for changes in the settings
 of the arguments of \code{gamma_hyp_prior}.}

\item{emiss_hyp_prior}{An optional list containing user specified parameters
 of the hyper-prior distribution on the multivariate normal distribution
 of the intercepts (and regression coefficients given that covariates are
 used) of the multinomial regression model of the emission distribution.
 The hyper-prior for the mean intercepts is a multivariate
 Normal distribution, the hyper-prior for the covariance matrix between the
 set of (state specific) intercepts is an Inverse Wishart distribution.

 Hence, the list \code{emiss_hyp_prior} contains the following elements:
 \itemize{\item{\code{emiss_mu0}: a list of lists: \code{emiss_mu0} contains
 \code{n_dep} lists, i.e., one list for each dependent variable \code{k}. Each
 of these lists contains m matrices; one matrix for each set of emission
 probabilities within a state. The matrices contain the hypothesized mean
 values of the intercepts. Hence, each matrix consists of one row (when not
 including covariates in the model) and \code{q_emiss[k]} - 1 columns}
 \item{\code{emiss_K0}: a list containing \code{n_dep} elements corresponding
 to each of the dependent variables, where each element is a numeric vector
 with length 1 denoting the number of hypothetical prior subjects on which
 the vector of means \code{emiss_mu0} is based}
 \item{\code{emiss_nu}: a list containing \code{n_dep} elements corresponding
 to each of the dependent variables, where each element is a numeric vector
 with length 1 denoting the degrees of freedom of the Inverse Wishart
 distribution}
 \item{\code{emiss_V}: a list containing \code{n_dep} elements corresponding
 to each of the dependent variables \code{k}, where each element is a matrix
 of \code{q_emiss[k]} - 1 by \code{q_emiss[k]} - 1 containing the
 hypothesized variance-covariance matrix between the set of intercepts.}}
 Note that \code{emiss_K0}, \code{emiss_nu} and \code{emiss_V} are assumed
 equal over the states. The mean values of the intercepts (and regression
 coefficients of the covariates) denoted by \code{emiss_mu0} are allowed to
 vary over the states.

 The default values for the hyper-prior on the emission distribution(s) are:
 all elements of the matrices contained in \code{emiss_mu0} set to 0,
 \code{emiss_K0} set to 1, \code{emiss_nu} set to 3 + \code{q_emiss[k]} - 1,
 and the diagonal of \code{gamma_V} (i.e., the variance) set to 3 +
 \code{q_emiss[k]} - 1 and the off-diagonal elements (i.e., the covariance)
 set to 0.

 See \emph{Details} below if covariates are used for changes in the settings
 of the arguments of \code{emiss_hyp_prior}.}

\item{gamma_sampler}{An optional list containing user specified settings for
 the proposal distribution of the random walk (RW) Metropolis sampler for
 the subject level parameter estimates of the intercepts modeling the
 transition probability matrix. The list \code{gamma_sampler} contains the
 following elements:
\itemize{\item{\code{gamma_int_mle0}: a numeric vector with length \code{m}
- 1 denoting the start values for the maximum likelihood estimates of the
intercepts for the transition probability matrix gamma, based on the pooled
data (data over all subjects)}
\item{\code{gamma_scalar}: a numeric vector with length 1 denoting the scale
factor \code{s}. That is, The scale of the proposal distribution is composed
of a covariance matrix Sigma, which is then tuned by multiplying it by a
scaling factor \code{s}^2}
\item{\code{gamma_w}: a numeric vector with length 1 denoting the weight for
the overall log likelihood (i.e., log likelihood based on the pooled data

 Default settings are: all elements in \code{gamma_int_mle0} set to 0,
 \code{gamma_scalar} set to 2.93 / sqrt(\code{m} - 1), and \code{gamma_w} set to
 0.1. See the section \emph{Scaling the proposal distribution of the RW

\details{
Covariates specified in \code{xx} can either be dichotomous or continuous
variables. Dichotomous variables have to be coded as 0/1 variables.
Categorical or factor variables can as yet not be used as predictor
covariates. The user can however break up the categorical variable in
multiple dummy variables (i.e., dichotomous variables), which can be used
simultaneously in the analysis. Continuous predictors are automatically
centered. That is, the mean value of the covariate is subtracted from all
values of the covariate such that the new mean equals zero. This is done such
that the presented probabilities in the output (i.e., for the population
transition probability matrix and population emission probabilities)
correspond to the predicted probabilities at the average value of the
covariate(s).

If covariates are specified and the user wants to set the values for the
parameters of the hyper-prior distributions manually, the specification of
the elements in the arguments of the hyper-prior parameter values of the
normal distribution on the means change as follows: the number of rows in the
matrices \code{gamma_mu0} and \code{emiss_mu0} are equal to 1 + the number of
covariates used to predict the transition probability matrix for
\code{gamma_mu0} and the emission distribution for \code{emiss_mu0} (i.e.,
the first row correspond to the hyper-prior mean values of the intercepts,
the subsequent rows correspond to the hyper-prior mean values of the
regression coefficients connected to each of the covariates), and
\code{gamma_K0} and \code{emiss_K0} are now a matrix with the number of
hypothetical prior subjects on which the vectors of means (i.e., the rows in
\code{gamma_mu0} or \code{emiss_mu0}) are based on the diagonal, and
off-diagonal elements equal to 0. Note that the hyper-prior parameter values
of the inverse Wishart distribution on the covariance matrix remains
unchanged, as the estimates of the regression coefficients for the covariates
are fixed over subjects.

Covariates specified in \code{xx} can either be dichotomous or continuous
variables. Dichotomous variables have to be coded as 0/1 variables.
