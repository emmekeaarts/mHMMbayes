\title{mHMMbayes: multilevel hidden Markov models using Bayesian estimation.}
\description{
With the \code{R} package \code{mHMMbayes} you can fit multilevel hidden
  Markov models. The multilevel hidden Markov model (HMM) is a generalization
  of the well-known hidden Markov model, tailored to accommodate (intense)
  longitudinal data of multiple individuals simultaneously. Using a
  multilevel framework, we allow for heterogeneity in the model parameters
  (transition probability matrix and conditional distribution), while
  estimating one overall HMM. The model has a great potential of application
  in  many fields, such as the social sciences and medicine. The model can be
  fitted on multivariate data with either a categorical or Normal
  distribution, and include individual level covariates (allowing for e.g.,
  group comparisons on model parameters). Parameters are estimated using
  Bayesian estimation utilizing the forward-backward recursion within a
  hybrid Metropolis within Gibbs sampler. Missing data (NA) in the dependent
  variables is accommodated assuming MAR.

\details{
The \code{mHMMbayes} package provides three main functions: \code{\link{mHMM}}
  , \code{\link{sim_mHMM}} and \code{\link{vit_mHMM}}, described below. For a more
  elaborate guide to the package \code{mHMMbayes}, see the tutorial-mhmm
  vignette: \code{vignette("tutorial-mhmm", package = "mHMMbayes")} . For extensive
  information on the estimation of the parameters in the package, see the estimation-mhmm
  vignette: \code{vignette("estimation-mhmm", package = "mHMMbayes")}.

\section{\code{mHMM}}{

The function \code{mHMM} fits a multilevel hidden Markov model to (intense longitudinal) data
from multiple subjects using Bayesian estimation. By using a
multilevel framework, one general 'population' HMM is estimated, while
heterogeneity between subjects is accommodated. The function can handle
covariates at the subject level varying observation lengths over
subjects. Estimation is performed using a hybrid Metropolis
within Gibbs sampler, and completes the forward backward algorithm for all
subjects in a sequential manner. Missing data (NA) in the dependent
  variables is accommodated assuming MAR.

\section{\code{sim_mHMM}}{

The function \code{sim_mHMM} simulates data for multiple subjects, for which
the data have (multivariate) categorical or continuous observations that
follow a hidden Markov model (HMM) with an multilevel structure. The
multilevel structure implies that each subject is allowed to have it's own
set of parameters, and that the parameters at the subject level (level 1) are
tied together by a population distribution at level 2 for each of the
corresponding parameters. The shape of the population distribution for each
of the parameters is a normal (i.e., Gaussian) distribution. In addition to
(natural and/or unexplained) heterogeneity between subjects, the subjects
parameters can also depend on a (set of) covariate(s).

\section{\code{vit_mHMM}}{

The function \code{vit_mHMM} obtains the most likely hidden state
sequence for each subject, given the data and the subject specific parameter
estimates. The function does this by utilizing the Viterbi algorithm.
