# Preface {#sec-preface}

Hidden Markov models [HMMs; @Rabiner1989] are a machine learning method that have been used in many different scientific fields to describe a sequence of observations for several decades. For example, translating a fragment of spoken words into text [i.e., speech recognition, see e.g. @Rabiner1989; @woodland2002], or the identification of the regions of DNA that encode genes [i.e., gene tagging, see e.g., @krogh1994; @henderson1997; @burge1998]. The development of this package is, however, motivated from the area of social sciences. Due to technological advancements, it becomes increasingly easy to collect long sequences of data on behavior. That is, we can monitor behavior as it unfolds in real time. An example here of is the interaction between a therapist and a patient, where different types of nonverbal communication are registered every second for a period of 15 minutes. When applying HMMs to such behavioral data, they can be used to extract latent behavioral states over time, and model the dynamics of behavior over time.\

A quite recent development in HMMs is the extension to multilevel HMMs [see e.g., @altman2007; @shirley2010; @rueda2013; @zhang2014; @deHaan2017]. Using the multilevel framework, we can model several sequences (e.g., sequences of different persons) simultaneously, while accommodating the heterogeneity between persons. As a result, we can quantify the amount of variation between persons in their dynamics of behavior, easily perform group comparisons on the model parameters, and investigate how model parameters change as a result of a covariate. For example, are the dynamics between a patient and a therapist different for patients with a good therapeutic outcome and patients with a less favorable therapeutic outcome?\

With the package `mHMMbayes`, one can estimate these multilevel hidden Markov models. This tutorial starts out with a brief description of the HMM and the multilevel HMM. For a more elaborate and gentle introduction to HMMs, we refer to @zucchini2016. Next, we show how to use the package `mHMMbayes` through an extensive example, also touching on the issues of determining the number of hidden states and checking model convergence. Information on the used estimation methods and algorithms in the package is given in the vignette [Estimation of the multilevel hidden Markov model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mHMMbayes/vignettes/estimation-mhmm.pdf).
