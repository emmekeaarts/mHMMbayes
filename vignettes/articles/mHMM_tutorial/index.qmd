# Abstract {.unnumbered}

With the `R` package `mHMMbayes` you can fit multilevel hidden Markov models. The multilevel hidden Markov model (HMM) is a generalization of the well-known hidden Markov model, tailored to accommodate (intense) longitudinal data of multiple individuals simultaneously. Using a multilevel framework, we allow for heterogeneity in the model parameters (transition probability matrix and conditional distribution), while estimating one overall HMM.

The model has a great potential of application in many fields, such as the social sciences and medicine. The model can be fitted on multivariate data with a categorical distribution, and include individual level covariates (allowing for e.g., group comparisons on model parameters). Parameters are estimated using Bayesian estimation utilizing the forward-backward recursion within a hybrid Metropolis within Gibbs sampler. The package also includes a function to simulate data and a function to obtain the most likely hidden state sequence for each individual using the Viterbi algorithm.
