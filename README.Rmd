# mHMMbayes

  With the \code{R} package mHMMbayes you can fit multilevel hidden Markov 
  models. The multilevel hidden Markov model (HMM) is a generalization of the well-known
  hidden Markov model, tailored to accommodate (intense) longitudinal data of 
  multiple individuals simultaneously. Using a multilevel framework, we allow 
  for heterogeneity in the model parameters (transition probability matrix and
  conditional distribution), while estimating one overall HMM. The model has a
  great potential of application in  many fields, such as the social sciences 
  and medicine. The model can be fitted on multivariate data with a categorical 
  distribution, and include individual level covariates (allowing for e.g.,
  group comparisons on model parameters). Parameters are estimated using 
  Bayesian estimation utilizing the forward-backward recursion within a hybrid 
  Metropolis within Gibbs sampler. The package also includes various options for 
  model visualization, a function to simulate data and a function to obtain the 
  most likely hidden state sequence for each individual using the Viterbi algorithm. 
  
  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding the 
  package. 

## Installation

You can install mHMMbayes from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("emmekeaarts/mHMMbayes")
```

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to run the model using example data 
included with the package, and how to simulate data. For a more elaborate
introduction, see the vignette "tutorial-mhmm" accompanying the package.
